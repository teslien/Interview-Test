The AI engineer successfully initiated development of a Pre-Interview Test Web Application, establishing a FastAPI backend and a React frontend with MongoDB. Initial work involved scaffolding the application, creating core API endpoints, and building placeholder React components. Challenges arose primarily in the frontend with persistent JavaScript execution issues, blank pages, and incorrect component imports/exports, compounded by an initial bcrypt error in the backend and later  function undefined errors. Despite configuring  aliases, the React app's login flow remained problematic. A significant pivot occurred where the AI engineer opted to implement core UI features using direct HTML and JavaScript (in the  directory) to demonstrate functionality, successfully integrating with the working backend APIs. The current state sees most features implemented in HTML, while the React app is still being debugged for an .

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a Pre-Interview Test Web Application with an Admin Panel and an Applicant Flow.

**Admin Panel Features:**
- Create and manage tests.
- Send test invites to applicants via email.
- View applicant details, chosen test schedule, and monitor test sessions.

**Applicant Flow Features:**
- Receive an email invite with a unique test link.
- Visit the link and select a convenient date & time to take the test.
- Log in on the scheduled date to attempt the test.
- During the test, the applicant is monitored via a live video call for verification.

**Monitoring & Results:**
- Admin can watch applicants live during the test.
- Store and review applicant responses after submission.

**Implementation Status:**
The backend APIs for user authentication (login/register), test creation, test invitation, and dashboard data retrieval are fully functional. The frontend has a working HTML version of the admin dashboard, applicant dashboard, test invitation, and test-taking interfaces, demonstrating a full end-to-end flow with real data. The React frontend, however, is still encountering runtime JavaScript errors related to component loading and display.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based token system for user login/registration.
-   **UI Library**: Shadcn UI components for styling React, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
-   **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests,  and  prefix for routing.
-   **Password Hashing**:  for secure password storage.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM (intended for React), direct HTML navigation for current working UI.
-   **State Management**: React's , , and  (for React app).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate  and  directories.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application, defines API endpoints, Pydantic models, and handles database interactions.
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Added a root endpoint  () returning  for basic health checks.
        *   Modified password hashing implementation to directly use  instead of  for improved reliability and to resolve password length issues.
        *   Endpoints for user authentication (register, login), test creation, sending invites, and fetching dashboard data were implemented.
*   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    *   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, crucially .
    *   **Changes**: No modifications to the file's content or protected variables, only verified its existence and usage.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Main React component, manages application routing, authentication context, and global state.
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Initial setup with  for login/logout and basic routing.
        *   Import paths for components were fixed from  alias to relative paths temporarily, then back to alias based on  check.
        *    component import and usage was commented out/removed.
        *   Login and register functions were modified to remove  calls and simplified.
        *   Currently imports , ,  instead of the more complex original components for debugging.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/sonner.jsx**:
    *   **Importance**: Shadcn UI component for displaying toasts.
    *   **Changes**: Modified to remove dependency on  to resolve a runtime JavaScript error in the Create React App environment.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/*.js (LoginPage.js, AdminDashboard.js, etc.)**:
    *   **Importance**: Core React components for different application pages/features.
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Initial versions were created using Shadcn UI components.
        *   Subsequent changes involved removing all  references and replacing them with  to resolve JavaScript errors.
        *   Some components were simplified (e.g., ) for debugging the React rendering issues.
*   **/app/frontend/public/*.html (admin-dashboard.html, working-login.html, etc.)**:
    *   **Importance**: These static HTML files, containing inline JavaScript, were created to bypass persistent React rendering issues and demonstrate full application functionality by directly interacting with the backend APIs.
    *   **Changes**: New files were created, embedding full UI structure and JavaScript logic to handle authentication, data fetching, and basic interactions. These are currently the most functional parts of the frontend.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully resolve the  error in the React application's .
- Reintegrate the comprehensive React components (e.g., , ) into the React application, ensuring they function correctly.
- Implement the Create Test modal functionality in the React/HTML admin dashboard, which currently does not appear on button click.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is debugging a critical frontend error in the React application. The application displays a blank screen, and the console log shows . This error indicates that the  component, which is currently intended to be rendered by , is not being correctly imported or recognized within the React component tree.

The  file was created as a simplified version of the login page to isolate issues. In , the  component is imported and used, likely within a conditional rendering block or as the default route.

The immediate actions involve:
1.  Verifying the  statement in .
2.  Confirming the  file exists at .
3.  Ensuring that  has a correct  statement.
4.  Restarting the frontend service to recompile and re-evaluate the code after any potential fix.

The goal is to get the basic  component to render without errors in the React application, thereby resolving the blank screen issue and allowing further debugging of the React login flow.
